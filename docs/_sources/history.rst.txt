Cellular Genetics programme (2015)
----------------------------------

The `Cellular Genetics programme <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/programmes/cellular-genetics>`_ at the Sanger Institute was created in 2015 by merging with the Computational Genomics programme. In the first two years the programme didn't have any core facility groups. In 2017 it was decided to create several core facility groups including ours to help the facutly groups do their research.

Early days
----------

In the early days of the programme (the first 2 years) all of the users analysed their data by themselves on the `LSF batch compute farm <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSETD4/product_welcome_platform_lsf.html>`_ available at the Sanger. This included both computational and non-computational users. Some people had never coded before. This introduced a lot of heterogeneity in the programme data.

Cloud (2017)
------------

In 2017 it was decided by Wellcome Trust to adapt to the modern cloud technologies and to move their compute to the cloud. The Sanger Institute decided to start with having a private OpenStack clound on premises and gradually move analysis from the LSF farm to the cloud. It created additional challenges for the end users and therefore it was decided to create the Cellular Genetics core facility informatics group which would standardise the analysis and help with transitioning to the cloud.

Cellular Genetics Informatics group (2018)
------------------------------------------

`Our group <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cellular-genetics-informatics>`_ was created in the beginning of 2018 and `Vladimir Kiselev <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/vladimir-yu-kiselev>`_ started as the head of the group. `Stijn van Dongen <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/van-dongen-stijn>`_ joined the group in May 2018 and `Anton Khodak <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/khodak-anton>`_ joined the group in June 2018.
