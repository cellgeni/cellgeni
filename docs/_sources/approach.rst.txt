Our vision
==========

When working on our projects and pipelines we follow several important principles.

No duplication of effort
------------------------

If something has been or can be done by others we will not develop our own tool for this.

Agile
-----

In our work we try use elements of the `Agile methodology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development>`_. We use `Jira <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>`_ as our main project management software.

User-oriented
-------------

We value our users not only as our customers (we use `Jira Service Desk <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk>`_ for all of the users' requests) but also as the most important source of ideas and feedback. Anyone can either email us on vk6@sanger.ac.uk or talk to us in `our Mattermost group <https://mattermost.sanger.ac.uk/cellgeninf>`_ (Sanger users can login using their Sanger credentials).

Feedback
--------

We also have monthly meetings with faculty group's representatives and weekly coffee standups where anyone can come, comment on our work, feedback or ask us any question.
