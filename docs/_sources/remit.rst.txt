Our remit and tools
===================

Our team provides efficient access to cutting-edge analysis methods for `Cellular Genetics programme <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/programmes/cellular-genetics>`_ at the Sanger Institute, which leads a number of world-class research initiatives including the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (`HIPSCI <http://www.hipsci.org/>`_) and `Human Cell Atlas <https://www.humancellatlas.org/>`_. Our team’s focus is the development and operation of workflows, tools and infrastructure for data analysis that support the programme’s research goals.

To run our pipelines we use both the `LSF compute cluster <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSETD4/product_welcome_platform_lsf.html>`_ and `OpenStack private cloud <https://www.openstack.org/>`_ solutions. We extensively use `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_ to orchestrate pipelines on the cloud. To run the pipelines we use both `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`_ and `CWL <https://www.commonwl.org/>`_.
