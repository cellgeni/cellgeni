Jupyter Hub
===========

We support a Jupyter Hub server running on Sanger Cloud. Jupyter allows you to run your analysis in multiple environments (``R``, ``python``, ``Julia``, etc.) and also to create and share notebooks containing your analysis, code, equations and visualizations. We think this is an ideal environment for any kind of downstream analysis. For more details please refer to `Jupyter Hub documentation <http://jupyter.org/hub>`_.

How to get access
-----------------

Our Jupyter Hub service is available in a web browser on any computer anywhere in the world. You will need to provide us with your GitHub ID to be able to login. Once we notify you that your account is created you can login using your GitHub credentials.

Notebooks
---------

We provide some notebook templates with the pre-installed software. These are located in the ``notebooks`` folder. Corresponding example data is located in the ``data`` folder. Before running your analysis, please make a copy of a notebook template, save it to your home folder and work with the copy. At the moment we have the following notebook templates:

1. `scanpy notebook for analysis of 10X data <https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/blob/master/files/notebooks/10X-scanpy.ipynb>`_
2. `Seurat notebook for analysis of 10X data <https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/blob/master/files/notebooks/10X-Seurat.Rmd>`_
3. `Batch correction notebook 1 <https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/blob/master/files/notebooks/10X-batch-correction-bbknn-scanorama.ipynb>`_
4. `Batch correction notebook 2 <https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/blob/master/files/notebooks/10X-batch-correction-harmony-mnn-cca-other.Rmd>`_
