Nextflow pipelines
==================

We offer a range of sequencing processing pipelines. We develop them using `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`_ workflow language.

For the end-users we offer Nextflow pipelines available to run on both Sanger *LSF* farm or *OpenStack* flexible compute environment. The pipelines can be run either by us or by the end-users themselves.

Here is the list of pipelines we develop:

1. `RNA-seq <https://github.com/cellgeni/rnaseq-noqc>`_ (both bulk and Smartseq2)
2. `ATAC-seq <https://github.com/cellgeni/atacseq>`_
3. `TraCeR/BraCer <https://github.com/cellgeni/tracer>`_
4. Droplet based protocols (inDrop, Seq-Well, Drop-seq)
5. `10X cellranger <https://github.com/cellgeni/10xcellranger>`_

.. note:: If you would like to run ``cellranger`` by *10X* please put in a ticket for the NPG group by emailing to new-seq-pipe@sanger.ac.uk and specify which version of the cellranger and the genome you would like to use.
